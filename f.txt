Machine Learning -- 
>We started the topic of today with CNN's and why they play an important role when proccessing a large dataset with alot of features , Big data consists alot of features and when it comes to images and videos these count of features even increase.

>Since in a Image or a video only some Features are important here the role of feature extraction comes into play.

>We implement a filter or kernel in our model which tries to detect the parts which are repeatedly used in the picture or , maybe doesn't help to detect an edge of any object , such as sky in a landscape. 

>This kernel size can be decided by us hence the bigger the size of our filter , the cahnces of more the details to be eliminated are.

>This process of extracting the edges of objects from a fullsized images using a kernel is known as Convutional , this is the first layer along with it we use RELU activation function and after that we use the concept of pooling , still we don't know about pooling as we discuss this in today's Class.

>We learnt about Pipeline in Jenkins as is provides visualization to see the chaining between jobs.
*Delievery pipeline
*Build Pipeline
 
>We learnt about exit 0 and exit 1 as 0 returns success when a job is done while returns failure if job failed.

>We can change the count of executors , as by default jenkins only runs 2 jobs at a time but we can change it.

>We get to know about curl command which can be used to check if a webpage is working or not , along wth it it can return STATUS CODES which are helpful in finding the success or failure.
